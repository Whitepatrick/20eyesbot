# 20eyesbot

20eyesbot is a twitter bot mostly
for me to play around with and give
me a reason to explore the twitter
API and also try adding PostgreSQL
functionality to it.

## What the bot does (or will do ;)):
###mentions & dm's
store any mention or DM into a postgres db
  - display stored tweet and DM data on 20eyes.org
reply to any mention with
  - "i serve the kwisatz haderach, @operations_ivy."

###announces jenkins info
retweet anything that says:
  - 20 eyes
  - twenty eyes
  - 20eyes
  - twentyeyes
